It was originally databased as from Auckland, New Zealand, but this overlooked a note “ex Holland P.Q. spec.” which inferred that this was a Post Entry Quarantine specimen from the Netherlands.
However a note inside the PDD packet reads “Rec. aust. Rose root”, which implies that it was from the roots of an Australian Rose plant. The originally recorded host of Elm appears to be taken from a literature reference to Chinese Elm “A root rot of Chinese Elm. Phytophthology 25 652-654” this article is a short note describing the disease from the Great Plains regions of the USA. The meaning of the “ex Holland” note is unclear; it may refer to Holland, Kansas; but this is not mentioned in the Phytophthology article.

In this paper, the isolate is referred to as Sporothrix inflata. 
DOI: 10.1111/1755-0998.12143

; Other Details: This sample was associated with wind throw and has been shown to have a relationship with borer insects (McCarthy et al. 2013). Althought the paper cites to this Sporothrix as a parasite, there is no data to back this information up. Molecular analysis shows that the isolate is a member of Sporothrix inflata species complex, but significantly different from the type of S. inflata. Therefore it is treated as Sporothrix sp. and future taxonomic studies should determine what is the exact species. Literature presents related isolates as root associates or saprophytes.
